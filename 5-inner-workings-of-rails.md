Now that you have completed the Blogger tutorial you have covered the basics of Rails. The next step is to focus in on the components that make rails work. These include models, controllers, views, routes databases and active record.

Richard Schneeman of University of Texas and Heroku fame has created a [10 week intro to Rails course](http://www.schneems.com/ut-rails/) designed to get you experimenting with the individual components of a typical app.

## Exercise

Work your way through the tutorials, watch the videos and complete all of the exercises.

### What to Keep in Mind

* As you work through these examples try to apply what you have learned to the blogger app to improve its functionality or simplify the code.
* Think of a project you would like to work on, when you get to the fifth section attempt to build it.
* The Float team are more than happy to help when you need to bounce ideas around.
* Breaking things is just as fun as making things.
