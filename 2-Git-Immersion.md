# Lesson 2 - Git Immersion

Git (and by extension GitHub) are the de facto version control system in use for web development today. In fact, we probably hired you in part because you shared some code you had written and shared on GitHub.

Git helps us share our code, work together, and rescues us from mistakes, which is pretty awesome if you ask me:

Git is great, but it can be a little hard to comprehend sometimes, so it would be a good idea to spend a little time playing around and learning with it. Thankfully, the nice guys at Neo have written _another_ tutorial to get you started (aren't they nice, you should take them :cake: or something).

**A word of warning:** if you have used Subversion, but not git, try to forget most of what you know about subversion. There is a lot of overlap between the two, but there are a lot of differences too. And often the same word will be used but has different meanings in both. Keep an open mind :)

## Let's go

This is an easy lesson (to describe anyway)

1. Go to [http://gitimmersion.com](http://gitimmersion.com)
2. Follow the instructions at least up to lab 45

## Notes

Again if you have questions, please write them down so we can discuss them later.
